## Overview

This repository contains all the essential files and resources for our project. Below, youâ€™ll find a brief description of the files and their purpose, as well as links to datasets and models used for training. Our aim is to address accident detection and classification using advanced AI techniques such as YOLO and CNN models.

### Files Description:

- **Why SHEHAB APP-IMPORTANT**: This file outlines our vision and mission for Team SHEHAB in the present and future, along with our goals for participating in the Absher 2024 Challenge.
  
- **SEHABYOLO.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for training the YOLO model used to classify the type of vehicle at fault in accidents.
  
- **SEHABCNNmodel.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook is for training the CNN model to classify the severity of an accident (Major, Minor, etc.).
  
- **Final_code.ipynb**: The final integrated model, which combines the YOLO and CNN models to detect the severity of the accident and identify the vehicle at fault.
  
- **yolo model.pt**: The trained YOLO model file. You can download the trained CNN model by following this link: [CNN Model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v90nAWkRJ8FXfiyl_CTgSQUCqdLkp302?usp=sharing).
  
- **Model Performance SEHAB**: A brief performance report that outlines the evaluation metrics of the YOLO model.
  
- **Test_images**: Contains sample images to test the models and validate their performance.

### Datasets:

- **YOLO Training Dataset**: The dataset used to train the YOLO model is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xY6wBHLggh9dFBfNel7NKmFKuaYo6V9L?usp=sharing).
  
- **CNN Training Dataset**: The dataset used to train the CNN model can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ocs7QfoBhIr2BsqG65IBke1hsCIzn-r4?usp=sharing).

### Future Stages:

- **Blockchain.pdf**: This document contains the proposed Proof of Concept (POC) for integrating blockchain technology into our solution.

We thank you for your time and consideration of our submission.
